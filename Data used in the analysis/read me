This is the species level data by combinning the local assembalges of PREDICTS and reigonal alien species data (Ants, Birds, Mammals, Spiders and 
Vascular plants). 
These five taxa were presented here separately.
The columns are similar with the ones in PREDICTS (added in the folder), except the last column (pg) that indicates the species in local assembalges
whether it is alien or not (predicts_invasive is alien, ipredicts_NA is not).
